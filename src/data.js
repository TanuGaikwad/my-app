    title: "Introduction to Python",
    content:"Python is a dynamic, interpreted (bytecode-compiled) language. There are no type declarations of variables, parameters, functions, or methods in source code. This makes the code short and flexible, and you lose the compile-time type checking of the source code. Python tracks the types of all values at runtime and flags code that does not make sense as it runs.An excellent way to see how Python code works is to run the Python interpreter and type code right into it.

Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming.
